# MinecraftPlugins
Minecraft plugins I make for me and a friend of mine to play.

I will finish the generate.bat when/if this repository gets big enough that it would be considered beneficial to improve multi-project build time.

Plugins might have some minor bugs that I haven't bothered to remove or didn't notice due to a lack of testing, I am aware. This is due to it being a personal project and not
considered to be released to the general public.
